                        <p class="">I feel strongly that mental health support should be easy to access and my aim is to help to bridge the gaps in current services.
                            In 2019 I experienced my own trauma,being diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after my son was born. Following treatment for this I experienced severe anxiety and
                            panic attacks. I was treated for this with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and through my discovery of yoga, meditation and the power of the present moment. This journey has taken me down a rabbit hole of ways to manage mental health without or alongside medication. Well-being from within is the combination of my biggest passions in life and I canâ€™t wait to share it with you!</p>
